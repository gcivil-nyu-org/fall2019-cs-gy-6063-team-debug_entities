### User Guide
Welcome to ShowUp, a web app for finding people to go with you to concerts. Let me show you how it works.

#### Sign Up
The first step toward finding concert buddies on ShowUp is signing up. It's pretty easy. Just go to the homepage, click "Sign up", enter your information, and click "Sign me up".

#### Edit your profile
After you've made an account, you can edit your profile to tell other users of ShowUp about yourself. Click the "My Profile" link in the header. From here, you can add a picture, write a bio, and choose your favorite genres. After you've done that, your profile might look something like this:

#### Join a Squad
If you have a group of friends you like to go to concerts with, you can all be in a Squad together. That means you'll  use ShowUp together to decide which concerts to go to and to find other people to go with. To add people to your Squad, click the "My Squad" link in the header, click "Edit Your Squad", type the email address of a person who has signed up with ShowUp, and click "Add User".

Another option is to have someone else add you to their Squad in the same way. Then you can click on "Requests" in the header to accept their request and join their Squad.

#### Find concerts that you're interested in or going to
Click on the "Events" link in the header to see concerts. Filter them by date, borough, performer, venue, and/or genre and mark yourself as interested in or going to a few events. To do that, find events that you like and click the "Interested" or "Going" buttons on each one.

#### Find other people who are interested in or going to the same concerts as you
After you've marked yourself as interested in or going to some concerts, it's time to find people to go with. Click the "Home" link in the header. Next to each concert, you'll see a link to its matching stack, which is where you can see the other people who are interested in or going to that event.

From there, you can decide whether or not you like the people you see. To help you make a decision, you can click on each person's name to see their profile. Once you've made up your mind, click the thumb up if you like the Squad you see, and click the thumb down otherwise.

If you like a Squad that has previously liked your Squad for this particular event, that means you've matched. You'll see a popup telling you that you've matched and you'll get the option to message them or keep swiping.

#### Message Squads that you've matched with
After you've matched with some other Squads, click on the "Matches" link in the header. For each event, you'll see the Squads that you've matched with. From there, you can message the Squad to make plans or click "View Squad" to see more information.

#### Go to concerts with your new friends
After you've matched with Squads and talked to them, you can meet them at the concert and have a good time together.
